                                    Bureau Public Procurement is the process whereby public sector organizations acquire goods, services and works from third parties. The process should be efficient, transparent, and competitive as much as feasible, in order to attain best value for public expenditure and inspire public confidence, considering the fact that the public are the major stakeholders of Government. Private sector Procurement (generally called Purchasing and Supply) also seeks to obtain goods and services at best value but, unlike a public sector organization, is not obliged to provide equal treatment to all its citizens in the business community. Accordingly, it is common in the private sector to construct longer-term relationships with a key group of suppliers and contractors and to seek efficiencies throughout the supply chain.

                                    The Plateau State Bureau of Public Procurement Law is based on the UNCITRAL model which is a properly regulated Procurement system benchmark on international best practice. The model draws from different legal cultures; balances the interest of foreign and domestic bidders; promotes transparency and allows great flexibility in the use of the provisions of the Law. The Law also established the Plateau State Public Procurement Agency and its Governing Board to formulate policies and guidelines for the application of the Law and ensure compliance by all public bodies.

                                What is the difference between the old system of Bureau of Procurement and the new system?

                                    In the old system, Procurement is centralized with contract award decisions taken by a central Tenders Board. Operations are guided by Financial Regulations / Treasury Circulars on public expenditure as issued by the Ministry of Finance. Over time and as Procurement expanded the FR/TC became grossly inadequate, giving room to discretionary application and promoting corruption. In the new system, Procurement is decentralized but with a central regulation through a Procurement Law. Responsibility for compliance rests with the Accounting Officer of the MDA and enforcement through a specialized Regulatory Agency (BPP). The new system is robust and effective and gives a step by step approach for each category of Procurement through the use of various standard documents and manuals.

                                The Law came into effect on 1st February, 2015, but no full implementation yet. Why?

                                    The Law recognize the need to put adequate and efficient structures in place in order to ensure a seamless implementation. This would include sensitization programs for all Stakeholders, capacity building for about 60 Procurement Officers services-wide (including the LGAs) and the setting up of the Regulatory Agency (PLSBPP). Accordingly, the Law provides for up to 6months for a gradual wind-down and transitioning between the outgoing and emerging systems of Procurement. During this transitioning, partial implementation is expected to commence in 2016 and full implementation by 2017. Before then, necessary regulations to guide implementation would have been released.
